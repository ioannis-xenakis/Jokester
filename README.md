The app that can make us laugh with its jokes! The android app that shows both dark-ish and more appropriate jokes to everyone. The app that shows jokes, for most tastes!

**WARNING**: Some of the jokes that the app shows, may be offensive for some people. No offense intended. Don't say I didn't warn you. The jokes are there to make us laugh, not offend people. When the 1.0.0-beta releases, it will have an option to show only non-offensive and appropriate jokes for everyone.

## Tools/ide used for app development
Built with Android Studio. Use The Stable version to build with me.

I would appreciate it a lot to help me build this app and make it better for the people to see and use it.
If you want, you can just drop some ideas for the app. You can drop your ideas as an "issue" on ["Issues" tab](https://github.com/ioannis-xenakis/Jokester/issues), then click on "New issue" and add your idea there. Thank you for seeing this!
