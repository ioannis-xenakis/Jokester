The app that can make us laugh with its jokes! The android app that shows both dark-ish and more appropriate jokes to everyone. The app that shows jokes, for most tastes!

**WARNING**: Some of the jokes that the app shows, may be offensive for some people. No offense intended. Don't say I didn't warn you. The jokes are there to make us laugh, not offend people. When the 1.0.0-beta releases, it will have an option to show only non-offensive and appropriate jokes for everyone.

- Also, if you want to code with me and help, you can create an issue in [issues tab](https://github.com/ioannis-xenakis/Jokester/issues) to tell me what kind of feature/help you want to suggest, then you can fork the project, clone your forked project to your android studio, create a branch from Develop branch, make your changes on the created branch and pull request on my Develop branch.
